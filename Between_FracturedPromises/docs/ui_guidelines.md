# UI/UX Design Guidelines

This document outlines the core principles of the user interface and experience design for "Between: Fractured Promises". Its purpose is to ensure visual and interactive consistency across the game.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Immersive Realism

The UI should feel like a real smartphone, but with an artistic layer that enhances the emotional tone of the story. Pacing, subtle animations, and color are our primary tools for storytelling within the interface.

## 2. Color-Coded Emotions

Color is used intentionally to signal the underlying emotional context of an interaction.

*   **Blue (`--color-trust-blue`):** Represents trust, loyalty, stability, and family. Used for the **Messenger** app and interactions with Ethan.
*   **Red (`--color-danger-red`):** Represents danger, passion, temptation, and secrets. Used for the **Makelove** app, secret chats, and notifications from Daniel.
*   **Orange (`--color-playful-orange`):** Represents playfulness, disruption, and lightheartedness. Used for the badges of characters like Olivia and Liam who challenge the status quo.
*   **Grey (`--color-neutral-grey`):** Used for neutral UI elements, incoming messages from others, and to provide a baseline for the more vibrant emotional colors.

## 3. Animation & Effects

Animations should be subtle and serve the narrative.

*   **Pulse:** A faint, slow pulse is used on buttons or icons to draw attention or indicate a "live" state.
*   **Fade:** Screen transitions should use smooth cross-fades to avoid jarring cuts.
*   **Glitch/Flicker:** These effects are reserved for high-tension moments, particularly in the **Makelove** and **Secret Chat** screens, to create a sense of instability.
*   **Typing Indicator:** The three bouncing dots should have a soft glow and appear with a realistic delay to build anticipation.
*   **Shattered Glass:** A key visual for the endgame, this overlay should spread slowly and cinematically.

## 4. Typography

*   **Primary Font:** A clean, modern sans-serif (e.g., Helvetica Neue) should be used for all primary UI text and chat messages for readability.
*   **Fractured Font:** A stylized serif with a "fractured" or "broken" appearance should be used for the main game logo and potentially for chapter titles to reinforce the game's theme.

## 5. Layout Rules

*   **Consistency:** All screens within the "phone" should adhere to a consistent layout grid. The top status bar should always be present.
*   **Padding:** Use generous padding within chat bubbles and around UI elements to avoid a cramped feeling.
*   **Visual Distinction:** The Messenger and Makelove apps must be immediately distinguishable by their color schemes and typography. Messenger is clean and bright; Makelove is dark and neon.
