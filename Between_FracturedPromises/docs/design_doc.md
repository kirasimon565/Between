# Game Design Document: Between: Fractured Promises

## 1. Overview

**Title:** Between: Fractured Promises

**Genre:** Narrative-driven, choice-based romantic thriller.

**Platform:** Web (HTML5, Twine-based).

**Logline:** A woman on the brink of a crumbling marriage finds herself caught between her loyal husband and a seductive stranger online, forcing her to make choices that will either mend her life or shatter it completely.

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop

The game is experienced through the UI of the main character Nadia's smartphone. The player's core loop consists of:

1.  **Receiving Notifications:** New messages arrive from different characters on two primary apps: **Messenger** (for family/friends) and **Makelove** (for the affair).
2.  **Making Choices:** The player chooses Nadia's responses in conversations. These choices directly impact key game variables.
3.  **Observing Consequences:** The story branches based on player choices, and the state of Nadia's relationships changes, reflected in the narrative and UI.
4.  **Exploring Profiles & Galleries:** The player can explore character profiles and photo galleries to piece together story details and character motivations.

## 3. Key Mechanics

*   **Dual-App Interface:** The core of the game is the separation between the blue, "safe" Messenger app and the red, "dangerous" Makelove app. This visually and thematically separates the two core conflicts.
*   **Variable Tracking:**
    *   **Trust:** Represents Ethan's faith in Nadia. High trust leads to reconciliation paths.
    *   **Romance:** Represents the progression of the affair with Daniel. High romance leads to temptation paths.
    *   **Suspicion:** Represents Ethan's suspicion. High suspicion can lead to negative confrontation.
*   **Player Customization:** The player has agency over Nadia's presentation through her profile, allowing them to customize her avatar, bio, and gallery to reflect their interpretation of her character.
